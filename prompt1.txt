Turning Strings to URL's:

prompt: 
  URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

requirements: 
  You can NOT use the replace() method or regex to solve this. solve with and without recursion.

inputs/outputs: 
  input: "jasmine ann jones"
  output: "jasmine%20ann$20jones"

  input: "hello there"
  output: "hello%20there"

questions to ask: 
  can i expect only strings?
  will the function expect only one input?

potential edge cases:
  a string with one character? with none?


plain text steps:
  1) separate string into array at " " with .split method
  2) rejoin array into a new string with .join("%20") to add the new element between each array element.
  3) return the new string

plain text steps, recursion:
  1) create function that takes three arguments(the string, the character to replace, what to replace it with)
  2) use the .length method to see if the string is only one character, if so, return the string (this is the branch that will break the recursive loop)
  3) create a variable to store the current charIndex (index)
  4) begin branching. If the string.charAt(0) === a space, change the value of index (index = %20)
  5) outside of branch, return index+function(input.substring(1), character to replace, what to replace with)

    .substring method tells the function to only look at the remainder of the string starting at index 1 - repeating this over and over will loop through the whole string
