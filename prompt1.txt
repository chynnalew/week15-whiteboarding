Turning Strings to URL's:

prompt: 
  URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

requirements: 
  You can NOT use the replace() method or regex to solve this. solve with and without recursion.

inputs/outputs: 
  input: "jasmine ann jones"
  output: "jasmine%20ann$20jones"

  input: "hello there"
  output: "hello%20there"

questions to ask: 
  can i expect only strings?
  will the function expect only one input?

potential edge cases:
  numbers? (if the string may contain numbers)
